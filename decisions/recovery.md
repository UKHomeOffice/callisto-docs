# Recovery

## Summary

### Issue
We want Callisto to be recoverable with minimal manual intervention so that our end users are not effected for too long by a disaster that takes it down


### Decision
WIP

### Status
Gathering information. The problem needs to be considered from an infrastrucutre and application perspective. In addition we should also think about how we communicate with our users in the event of a disaster to keep them in the loop around what is going on and if we can an ETA for when service will be resumed. We also need to think about work aorund processes to allow users to keep working if Callisto is not available


## Details

### Assumptions
We prefer to adopt an existing solution or set of solutions as opposed to developing our own

We prefer a solution that we do not have to patch and upgrade

We prefer a solution where we do not have to explicitly trigger scaling in or out

### Constraints
Whatever we select must work in the context of ACP

### Options
We are researching options now
